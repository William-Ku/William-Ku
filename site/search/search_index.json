Hello everyone, my name is William. I am currently a highschool student from Kaohsiung American School. I live in Tainan, Taiwan, and I am really passionate about coding. The school personal project is to allow students to develop our own interest and learn through the process of development. I have created this website all by myself using the material theme in mkdocs. To explain why I am passionate about coding, I will need to talk about my childhood. I really enjoyed watching my aunt playing video games when I was young. I am surprised by how people can control the game character just by simply pressing the keyboard. My aunt used to play a lot of problem solving and RPG games which I think was awesome. The favorite RPG game is called \u4e0a\u53e4\u795e\u5668, it is a single player game where you walk around the city and complete different missions, you will gain power by fighting monster throughout your journey. The reason why I enjoy RPG games is because the different action you make in the game will impact the ending of the game. Taking Undertale, the best PC game in 2015, as an example. Every action you take in the game will impact your \u201cLOVE\u201d and \u201cEXP\u201d which ultimentaly lead to a Genocide ending or a True Pacifist ending. This kind of real time interaction with players is what makes RPGs so attractive, every single character in the game have their own personalities and characteristics. In my words, they have soul Due to the passion in video games, I want to create one of my own. In order to do so I have to learn programming, as it makes my mom happy because she thinks I finally find a hobby that is useful. I have found coding to be not as interesting as I originally thought it would be when I get into formal programming class, it is not as fancy as it is shown in movies. Coding is like math combined with logic, my brain hurts when I have to do lots of calculations, I soon want to quit. My parents don\u2019t want me to quit and force me to try harder, and after more and more practice and years of learning, I have again found programming fun. Programming is fun because you can design your own dreams with it. When you are used to all the fundamentals, you can start designing some bigger projects, which is where the fun parts come in.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#who-am-i","text":"Hello everyone, my name is William.
